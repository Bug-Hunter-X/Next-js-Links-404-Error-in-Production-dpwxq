# Next.js Links 404 Error in Production

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js where links work correctly in development but return 404 errors in production. The problem arises from incorrect configuration of the `next/link` component or mismatched routes.

## Bug

The provided code uses Next.js's `Link` component to navigate to different pages. In development, the links function correctly. However, when deployed to production, the links lead to 404 errors, indicating that the server cannot find the linked pages.

## Solution

The solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the routes specified in the `Link` component accurately match the pages defined in the application's `pages` directory and that the `next export` command (if used for static site generation) is executed correctly. Any discrepancies between the links and routes need to be resolved for the application to function correctly in production.

The provided solution file includes the corrected code, addressing any issues in the page routing configuration.
